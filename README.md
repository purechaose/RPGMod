This is (going to be) a mod that will add more RPG functionalities into Minecraft, like self sustaining and repairing villages, towns, cities, etc., dynamic law enforcement (will be explained later), among other things.

The idea for this mod came from the Fantasy City Build Challenge ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1332250-challenges-%E2%99%A6fantasy-city-build%E2%99%A6/ ) and some difficulties people have found with it.
